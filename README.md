# Oil Fingerprinting

Crude oils from various regions differ in the plant and animal source materials, 
as well as the time, temperature, and pressure conditions that occurred during formation.
Therefore, each crude oil has a unique fingerprint that can potentially be determined using biomarkers.

The aim of this project is to predict the oil group depending on the biomarkers ratios via Machine Learning.

The dataset was taken from the Appendix A (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petsci.2023.11.010). 
There you can also find a detailed description of the source data.
